					<p>This title amongst the Muhammadans comprehends the concrete character of prophet, priest, and king; and is used to signify “the Vicar of God on earth.” <cite>—⁠Habesci’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">State of the Ottoman Empire</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 9. Herbelot, <abbr>p.</abbr> 985</cite> <a href="vathek.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-2" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>The author of Nighiaristan hath preserved a fact that supports this account; and there is no history of Vathek, in which his “terrible eye” is not mentioned. <a href="vathek.xhtml#noteref-2" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-3" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>This Caliph was eminent above all others for temperance and self-denial; insomuch, that he is believed to have been raised to Muhammad’s bosom, as a reward for his abstinence in an age of corruption. <cite>—⁠Herbelot, <abbr>p.</abbr> 690</cite> <a href="vathek.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-4" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>A city of the Babylonian Irak, supposed to have stood on the site where Nimrod erected his tower. Khondemir relates, in his life of Motassem, that this prince, to terminate the disputes which were perpetually happening between the inhabitants of Baghdad and his Turkish slaves, withdrew from thence; and, having fixed on a situation in the plain of Catoul, there founded Samarah. He is said to have had in the stables of this city a hundred and thirty thousand pied horses; each of which carried, by his order, a sack of earth to a place he had chosen. By this accumulation, an elevation was formed that commanded a view of all Samarah, and served for the foundation of his magnificent palace. <cite>—⁠Herbelot, <abbr>p.</abbr> 752, 808, 985. <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">Anecdotes Arabes</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 413</cite> <a href="vathek.xhtml#noteref-4" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-5" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>The Virgins of Paradise, called, from their large black eyes, <i xml:lang="ar-Latn">Hur al oyun</i>. An intercourse with these, according to the institution of Muhammad, is to constitute the principal felicity of the faithful. Not formed of clay, like mortal women, they are deemed in the highest degree beautiful, and exempt from every inconvenience incident to the sex. <cite>—⁠Al Koran; passim</cite> <a href="vathek.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><i xml:lang="ar-Latn">Genn</i> or <i xml:lang="ar-Latn">Ginn</i>, in the Arabic, signifies a Genius or Demon⁠—a being of a higher order, and formed of more subtle matter than man. According to Oriental mythology, the Genii governed the world long before the creation of Adam. The Muhammadans regarded them as an intermediate race between angels and men, and capable of salvation: whence Muhammad pretended a commission to convert them. Consonant to this, we read that, “When the servant of God stood up to invoke him, it wanted little but that the Genii had pressed on him in crowds, to hear him rehearse the Koran.” <cite>—⁠Herbelot, <abbr>p.</abbr> 357.

					<p>This was both the supreme council, and court of justice, at which the Caliphs of the race of the Abassides assisted in person to redress the injuries of every appellant. <cite>—⁠Herbelot, <abbr>p.</abbr> 298</cite> <a href="vathek.xhtml#noteref-9" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-14" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>The heinousness of Vathek’s profanation can only be judged of by an orthodox Mussulman; or one who recollects the ablution and prayer indispensably required on the exoneration of nature. <cite>—⁠Sale’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book"><abbr>Prelim.</abbr> <abbr>Disc.</abbr></i> <abbr>p.</abbr> 139.

					<p>This mountain, which in reality is no other than Caucasus, was supposed to surround the earth, like a ring encompassing a finger. The sun was believed to rise from one of its eminences (as over Octa, by the Latin poets) and to set on the opposite; whence “from Kaf to Kaf,” signified from one extremity of the earth to the other. <a href="vathek.xhtml#noteref-15" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>This is that wonderful bird of the East concerning which so many marvels are told. It was not only endowed with reason, but possessed also the knowledge of every language. This creature relates of itself, that it had seen the great revolution of seven thousand years, twelve times, commence and close; and, that in its duration, the world had been seven times void of inhabitants, and as often replenished. The Simurgh is represented as a great friend to the race of Adam, and not less inimical to the Dives. <a href="vathek.xhtml#noteref-16" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
